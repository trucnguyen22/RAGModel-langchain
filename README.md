# RAGModel

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model designed to process and generate responses based on provided datasets. The model combines retrieval-based techniques with generative capabilities to produce contextually relevant outputs.

## Example Dataset: "AliceInWonderland"

The RAGModel has been tested using the "AliceInWonderland" dataset as an example. This dataset allows the model to retrieve relevant passages from the text and generate coherent responses or summaries based on the retrieved content.
